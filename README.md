This is our appendix for the STA457 Final project. Our group is Aiden, Megh, Lam, and Zifan.
We initially knitted the rmd file to showcase our code. However, it beyond exceeded the page cap (45 pages),
so the code will be placed here. If you need to run the code, just palce it into the directory with the two 
datasets given in the project. Note: The last bit is commented out, as it was run with a split training set,
requiring additional variables that the full model does not need. If you would like to run that portion, feel
free to contact us.
